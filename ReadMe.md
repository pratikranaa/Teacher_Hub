## 📋 Overview

Teacher Hub is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the process of managing substitute teacher requests and assignments in educational institutions. The platform bridges the gap between schools needing qualified substitutes and teachers looking for opportunities, making the entire process efficient and transparent.

Our solution addresses critical pain points in the education sector:

- Schools struggle to find qualified substitutes on short notice
- Substitute teachers have difficulty finding consistent opportunities
- Manual assignment processes are time-consuming and error-prone
- Lack of centralized systems leads to communication breakdowns

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database Connection Errors**

2. **JWT Authentication Issues**

   - Check that SECRET_KEY is properly set
   - Verify token expiration times in settings.py
   - Clear browser cookies and local storage if experiencing login issues
3. **Email Sending Failures**

   - Confirm email settings in .env file
   - For Gmail, ensure "Less secure app access" is enabled or use App Passwords
   - Test email configuration: `python manage.py send_test_email your-email@example.com`
4. **Frontend API Connection Issues**

   - Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL is correctly set
   - Check CORS settings in backend/settings.py
